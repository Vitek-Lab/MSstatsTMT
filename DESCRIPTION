Package: MSstatsTMT
Title: Protein Significance Analysis in shotgun mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments with tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling
Version: 2.12.1
Date: 2024-04-23
Description: The package provides statistical tools for detecting differentially abundant proteins in shotgun mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments with tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. It provides multiple functionalities, including aata visualization, protein quantification and normalization, and statistical modeling and inference. Furthermore, it is inter-operable with other data processing tools, such as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS and SpectroMine.
