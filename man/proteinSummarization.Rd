\title{Summarizing PSM level quantification to protein level quantification}
\usage{
proteinSummarization(data, method = "msstats", normalization = TRUE,
  MBimpute = TRUE, maxQuantileforCensored = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Name of the output of PDtoMSstatsTMTFormat function or PSM-level quantified data from other tools. It should have columns ProteinName, PeptideSequence, Charge, PSM, Mixture, TechRepMixture, Run, Channel, Condition, BioReplicate, Intensity}

\item{method}{Four different summarization methods to protein-level can be performed : "msstats"(default), "MedianPolish", "Median", "LogSum".}

\item{normalization}{Normalization between MS runs. TRUE(default) needs at least one normalization channel in each MS run, annotated by 'Norm' in Condtion column. It will be performed after protein-level summarization. FALSE will not perform normalization step. If data only has one run, then normalization=FALSE.}

\item{MBimpute}{only for method="msstats". TRUE (default) imputes missing values by Accelated failure model. FALSE uses minimum value to impute the missing value for each PSM.}

\item{maxQuantileforCensored}{We assume missing values are censored. maxQuantileforCensored is Maximum quantile for deciding censored missing value, for instance, 0.999. Default is Null.}
}
\value{
data.frame with protein-level summarization for each run and channel
}
\description{
We assume missing values are censored and then impute the missing values. Protein-level summarization from PSM level quantification should be performed before testing differentially abundant proteins.
After all, normalization between MS runs using normalization channels will be implemented.

\examples{
data(input.pd)

quant.pd.msstats <- proteinSummarization(input.pd,
                                         method="msstats",
                                         normalization=TRUE)
