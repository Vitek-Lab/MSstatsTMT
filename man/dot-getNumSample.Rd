.getNumSample(
  desiredFC,
  power,
  alpha,
  delta,
  median_sigma_error,
  median_sigma_subject,
  median_sigma_run
)
}
\arguments{
\item{desiredFC}{the range of a desired fold change which includes the lower 
and upper values of the desired fold change.}

\item{power}{a pre-specified statistical power which defined as the probability 
of detecting a true fold change. TRUE represent you require to calculate the power 
for this category, else you should input the average of power you expect. Default is 0.9}

\item{alpha}{significance level}

\item{delta}{difference between means (?)}

\item{median_sigma_error}{median of error standard deviation}

\item{median_sigma_subject}{median standard deviation per subject}
