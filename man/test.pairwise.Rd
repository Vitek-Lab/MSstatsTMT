\title{Example of output from groupComparisonTMT function}
\format{
A data frame with 60 rows and 7 variables.
}
\usage{
test.pairwise
}
\description{
It is the output of groupComparisonTMT function,
which is the result of group comparions with the output of proteinSummarization function.
It should include the columns as below.
The variables are as follows:
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item Protein : Protein ID
  \item Label: Label of the pairwise comparision or contrast
  \item log2FC: Log2 fold change
  \item SE: Standard error of the comparsion of contrast results
  \item DF: Degree of freedom
  \item pvalue: Value of p statistic of the test
  \item adj.pvalue: adjusted p value
  \item issue: used for indicating the reason why a comparison is not testable. NA means the comparison is testable. 
  'oneConditionMissing' means the protein has no measurements in one conndition of the comparison.
  Furtherone, when 'issue = oneConditionMissing', 'log2FC = Inf' means the negative condition 
  (with coefficient -1 in the Label column)  is missing and 'log2FC = -Inf' means 
  the positive condition (with coefficient 1 in the Label column)  is missing.
  completeMissing' means the protein has no measurements in all the connditions of the comparison.
  unfittableModel' means there is no enough measurements to fit the linear model. 
  In other words, each condition has only one measurement.
